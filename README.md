# Volo

Volo — a personal assistant that keeps your loved ones informed about your flights.

## What is it?

When you travel, you add your flight details to Volo and the app takes care of updating your close family or friends via WhatsApp messages — from boarding to landing, with delays and other important updates.

## How it helps

- Simple: enter your flight once; Volo handles the rest
- Reassuring: your close circle stays informed automatically
- Private: you choose who gets notified

## How it works

1. Add a flight (from/to/date and optional flight number)
2. Pick who should be notified
3. Volo sends helpful WhatsApp updates as your journey progresses

## Screens

Below are a few example screens from the app:

</p>
